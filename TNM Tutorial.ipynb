    "### Welcome to the Topic Noise Models Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this tutorial you will...\n",
    "1. Learn to use Topic Noise Discriminator (TND), Noiseless LDA (NLDA), and Guided Topic Noise Model (GTM).\n",
    "2. Learn how to interpret the results of these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to setting up your code:\n",
    "1. Make sure that your python environment has `gdtm` installed.  You can install it using pip: `pip install gdtm`.  There is a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory that you can use to install everything you need in one go.\n",
    "2. You will also need the source code of the topic models, which are built in Java. The models you will need for this tutorial are `mallet-gtm`, `mallet-lda`, and `mallet-tnd`. You can find them in this repository: https://github.com/GU-DataLab/topic-noise-models-source\n",
    "4. Download the data set that we will be using from the Massive Data Institute (MDI) at Georgetown University here: https://portals.mdi.georgetown.edu/public/covid-19-misinformation-detection\n",
    "5. By following the directions in the link above, you will be sent an email with the data set attached in a zipped folder.  Unzip the folder and put it inside the `data/` folder in the root directory.\n",
    "6. Follow the directions throughout this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About this data set\n",
    "This data set was created by MDI to facilitate testing of misinformation detection models.  This data set revolves around the Covid-19 pandemic and contains six different topics that were prone to misinformation.  The topics are: hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, 5G internet, UV-light, mosquitoes, and disinfectants.  This data was collected from March 2020 to August 2020."

    "### What do we see in these topics?\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, NLDA is a randomized algorithm.  That means that the results will not be exactly the same every time.  Often, we will run a topic model a number of times and take the result that maximizes some metric.  We don't cover evaluation metrics in this tutorial, but you can find a description of the ones we like best [here](https://www.churchill.io/papers/topic_noise_models.pdf).  The two metrics are diversity and coherence, and together they measure how unique individual topics are to each other, and how easy each topic is to interpret by a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we see in our topic set are topics about mosquitoes, 5g, antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, disinfectants (bleach, alcohol), and UV light.  We can very easily see that the six topics included in our data set are present.  In our topic set, the UV light and disinfectants topics are somewhat merged together, and there are words belonging to the disinfectant topic that are off in other topics  (clorox, lysol).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So why did we use ten topics instead of just 6?\n",
    "We always ask for more topics than we expect to see because there are usually other topics that we didn't know existed that might take the place of one that we expect to see.  If we look at the four other topics in this set, we can see that one is about general remedies (hand sanitizer, water, washing hands, masks, and stayhome).  Another is a more general covid topic containing words like corona, flu, pandemic, china, wuhan, and healthcare).  Another topic seems to revolve around covid cases and deaths, while the last is a mashup, containing words like world, health, myth, lockdown, and facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "By allowing for more topics than we expect to see, we will discover new topics and allow space for the most meaningful topics to grow without interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now that we have taken a look at the topics, let's glance at noise.\n",
    "Note that each word is accompanied by a frequency.  That is the frequency with which a word was selected as a noise word."

    "### What is the first thing that we notice in the noise distribution?\n",
    "What we notice is that the titles of the six topics are all at the top of the noise distribution.  Why?\n",
    "This occurs because of the way that the data was collected.  Tweets were collected based on these keywords, and so every tweet must contain one of these.  Therefore, these words are incredibly common in the data set and are more likely to be chosen as noise.  However, you will also notice that in many cases, their probability of being in their respective topics was so strong that they were still chosen as topic words.  This is exactly how we expect the noise removal process to work.  Regardless of a word's overall frequency, it is the relation between its probability in a topic and its probability in noise that matters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Now that we have seen how an unsupervised topic noise model works, let's take a look at a semi-supervised model: Guided Topic Noise Model (GTM)\n",
    "GTM requires a set of seed topics to perform semi-supervised learning.  In the root directory, there is an empty file named `seeds.txt`.  Based on the topics that you saw above, put together a list of seed topics.  Each row should be a seed topic, with words separated by commas, like this: \n",

    "Because of how clean of a data set this is, there is not a huge gap in topic quality between GTM and NLDA.  However, there are some noteable differences.  First, all of the seed topics are in the order that they appear in your `seeds.csv` file.  This makes them far easier to identify.  Second, we can see that the disinfectants and UV light topics are clearly their own topics this time around, and that the disinfectants topic is much stronger than before, with clorox, lysol, and wipes included.\n",
    "\n",
    "These topics are easy for models to find, because they are built into the data set by design.  What about topics that we don't know are there for certain.  Try adding other seed topics (and increasing the number of topics in the model), and see if any pop out at you.\n",

    "Topic Noise Models are designed to perform better with more data.  The noise distribution in particular benefits from as many observations as it can get.  There is another fun, and much larger, data set that we can investigate using topic models.  It revolves around the 2020 United States presidential election.

There are optimizations built in for multiple processors and larger servers, which is why the source code of these models is Java and not Python (which does not currently support multiple processors or multithreading).\n",

See what kind of topics are present in the election data set.  Create some seed topics and see if you can refine the topics into a strong, actionable topic set."
